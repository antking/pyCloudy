A set of tools to manage Gary Ferland's Cloudy photoionization code. It provides objects and functions to:
**generate input files (including for grids)** read the output files
**give easy access to most of the outputs, to plot for example radial variation of emissivities, ionic fractions, etc..** generate pseudo 3D photoionization models, including line profile computation and PV diagrams

The code is actually on the pypi server at : http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyCloudy/
